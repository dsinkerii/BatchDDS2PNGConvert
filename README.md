# BatchDDS2PNGConvert
A batch python script to convert a folder with .DDS image files to .PNG for linux. Specifically for linux. I haven't tested on windows.

this repo desperately needs more care & contributors. Please submit issues and PR's to improve the repo.

i made this repo just to make a judgment meme, but ended up making an entire repo to convert dds to png due to the fact majority of linux softwares fail to convert some files.

# Pros & cons of using this repo:
- already includes all of the necessary pip packages. Please test if this works on your machine, i don't really know if it does or not
- has a custom DX10 conversion algorithm (<- SEVERELY BUGGED, needs more attention.)
